Challenge Mode Stage 1
======================

Area 1
------

[![Challenge Mode - Stage 1 - Area 1](/assets/images/guides/challenge-mode-stage-1-area-1.webp)](/assets/images/guides/challenge-mode-stage-1-area-1.webp){:target="_blank"}

### Room 1

If you have a ranger, get them to stand on the pressure plate numbered 1, while the force gets the boxes. The reason for a ranger to stand on the switch, is that they can hit monsters whilst staying on the plate. If there isn't a ranger, a hunter will have to do it.

### Room 2

Two hunters should wait here whilst the force and another char should go into the next room. The other char that went with the force should come back to this room, when they have activated the switch.

### Room 3

The ranger/hunter should stand on the switch whilst the force runs over to the gates marked 2. The force should activate switch 3 so that the hunters can proceed to the warp. The non-force should return to the previous room to help the hunters through the warp. The force should not bother wasting time killing the monsters in this room and go brake open the boxes to the south of the room, then go to door 5 and wait for the others to open it.

### Room 4

Two hunters should warp into this room and be shortly followed by the person who helped the force. Once the doors have unlocked, one person should go south and activate switch 5, the other two should open the boxes and wait by the north door.

### Room 5

The force will be the first one to enter this room. They should push the switch and run south into the next room. If there aren't a lot of enemies in this room, they should break open the boxes and hit the switch. You should all meet up about the same time, and drop any items you don't need before you proceed to Forest 2.

## Area 2

* Room 1
  * You should all enter Forest 2 at about the same time. The force should head down the slope and get the boxes will the others continue on.
* Room 2
  * If you are doing TA (Time Attack) then the force should join you. Otherwise, the force should peel off and get the boxes in the north east room. Don't attack. If there are too many monsters, then just leave the boxes and rejoin the others.
* Room 3
  * Again, the force should go on box hunting duties if you aren't doing TA.
* Room 4
  * Once all the monsters have been defeated (this can be a very bad room), the force should head towards the gate in the south of the room. One other person should go and get the timed pressure plate (switch number 1). The others should wait by the container blocking the way.
* Room 5
  * This can be quite frustrating if someone who doesn't know what to do takes the teleporter. You have to take the teleporter behind you, instead of the one infront. If someone does take the wrong teleporter, then whilst they run back, someone else go get the switch.

Before you go to the boss stage, you should make sure that the force has at least one scape doll. You should get rid of anything that you don't need, and if a ranger has a spare gun, they should drop that for the hunters to use. Standard practice really.

## Area 3

This is where you will probably fail the mission. This boss can be very frustrating for hunters. As always, when you do enough damage to the dragon, it will fall on its knees. You will most probably get hit when it does. Some of the time, this attack will kill you in one, so if you don't have a scape doll, the best thing to do is use a gun, if you have one. Forces who don't have barta at this point are partically useless. They should just try and avoid the dragon's attack and use whatever fluids you have left.
